Hi, This is Dipraj Howlader. Hope, You are fine..

This is my website named : "Vengari". Actually, mostly time you buy food and products from VENGARI. so, I think , it may be a good name  Here is about day to day life products buy and sell information.

1st, you will see a display having many products. If you want to one, first you have to Sign In.After signing in, you will see a checkout page. If you click "Place Order" button, Order will be placed and you will see a confirmation page. 2nd, If you click on Admin page , You can add any product , and it will show in home display. On top, you will see Manage Product button. After clicking the button , You can delete any product from the UI.If you click "Orders" button from main UI, you will see what you have ordered. That all.

This is a Full Stack Website. I use here React.js for frontend, Express.js for backend, MongoDB for storing data!

Features : I added features like - React Router, PrivateRouter, Google Login Authentication, Simple Email & Password Log in Authentication, Sign Up authentication, Context API,Spinner, Dynamic Information and Images etc. It is responsive too. I request to use Google Pixel 2 phone for checking responsivity .
